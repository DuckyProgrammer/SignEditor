# SignEditor

SignEditor is a Minecraft Plugin created to allow server administrator/operators to easily edit signs placed on the server without the need to break the signs.

I decided to create this plugin due to other plugins not having a Sign GUI and therefore would possibly cut off text. Using this plugin will allow you to know if a message will fit or not.

## Features

- Uses color codes (&)
- Supports text formatting (&k, &o, etc)
- Uses a Sign GUI to allow you to test if a message will actually fit on the sign.

## Why use Sign Editor?

It allows you to easily change the text on a sign without worry of words getting cut off.

## To-Do / Planned Features
- Add customizable messages.
